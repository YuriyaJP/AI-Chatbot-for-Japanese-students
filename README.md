## Project Details

- **Date**: January 2023 - Ongoing

## Description

The School Chatbot is designed to provide students with quick and accurate answers to their school-related questions. It is fed with specific data about the school students attend, and this data is constantly updated as new information becomes available. The chatbot currently supports the English language, with plans to improve and introduce a Japanese version in the future.

## Goal

The main goal of the School Chatbot is to assist students with their school-related queries, including homework help, class material retrieval, and information about missed classes. Instead of bothering teachers during their free time or feeling too shy to ask classmates, students can turn to their school chatbot for answers to specific class-related questions. It's important to note that the data used by this chatbot is tailored to the specific educational institution it serves and may not be applicable to other schools.
